# ThePongGame
Pong game with OOP paradigm and sound

this game was made by using basic UI turtle class, winsound.

# I struggle with this project when converting The whole project in to executable .exe files
# because of the pyinstaller convention of references and additional files.

if you interested in this game music, here are list of music i used:

https://www.silvermansound.com/free-music/happynes
https://freesound.org/people/jordanielmills/sounds/167535/

or maybe you just dowload the whole sound directory. 

# anyways, enjoy.
